#What Is All These Files' Names about?
Oh, yes, there are rules of naming: 

* When a folder's name is begin with "X", it means that this folder contains codes that shows as examples in the book.
* When a folder's name is begin with "E", it contains exercise(or homework, you may call it) follows the chapter in the book.
* The numbers after the "X" or "E" with "-" among them correspond with the chapter number.
* If there is no "E" or "X" in the name, it is only my own projects when I was trying to figure some questions out of the book.

#How Can I Find You?
My E-mail: <angdichu@gmail.com>
I will be very glad if you find some mistakes in it, even in grammar. And I am will to help if you have any questions.

However, I still have to say, unlike most people in GitHub, I am just a beginner, so what I can do to help may be little. But I am looking forward to looking for solutions with you. Just as what George Bernard Shaw said, 

>If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.
